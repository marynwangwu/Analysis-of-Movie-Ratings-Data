# Hypothesis Testing of Movie Ratings Data

In this project, I demonstrated essential skills in hypothesis testing using a real dataset from a replication attempt of published research by Wallisch & Whritner (2017). The objective was to answer specific questions related to movie ratings, simulating a scenario where I was working for a major movie studio. Through careful selection and execution of various hypothesis tests, I provided insights and data-driven recommendations to optimize the studio's operations.

# Applying Machine Learning Methods to Movie Ratings Data

In this subsequent project, I demonstrated essential machine learning skills using the same dataset as in the hypothesis testing project. The aim was to highlight the differences between machine learning methods and traditional inferential methods. By applying various machine learning algorithms to the movie ratings data, I explored and illustrated what machine learning can and cannot achieve. This comparative analysis was crucial in understanding the strengths and limitations of machine learning in this context. 

## Results

The results were compiled into a **comprehensive report**: [`Analysis_of_Movie_Ratings.pdf`](Analysis_of_Movie_Ratings.pdf), with figures used to effectively communicate the key findings and support the arguments presented.

## Dataset

This dataset features ratings data of 400 movies from 1097 research participants.

1st row: Headers (Movie titles/questions) â€“ note that the indexing in this list is from 1

Row 2-1098: Responses from individual participants

Columns 1-400: These columns contain the ratings for the 400 movies (0 to 4, and missing)

Columns 401-421: These columns contain self-assessments on sensation seeking behaviors (1-5)

Columns 422-464: These columns contain responses to personality questions (1-5)

Columns 465-474: These columns contain self-reported movie experience ratings (1-5)

Column 475: Gender identity (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described)

Column 476: Only child (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response)

Column 477: Movies are best enjoyed alone (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response)
